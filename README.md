# CVD/OI Expansion Strategy Documentation

## Overview
The CVD/OI Expansion Strategy leverages Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) and Open Interest (OI) metrics to identify trading opportunities in the crypto market. This document outlines the strategy and provides setup instructions, usage guidelines, and an overview of the project structure.

## Strategy
### What is CVD?
Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) measures the difference between buying and selling pressure. It helps traders identify bullish and bearish trends.

### What is OI?
Open Interest (OI) indicates the total number of outstanding contracts (futures or options) that have not been settled. Higher OI can indicate stronger market trends.

### CVD/OI Expansion Concept
The CVD/OI expansion strategy combines these two metrics to identify potential price moves and trade setups. The trader looks for divergences between CVD and price movement, particularly when coupled with changes in OI.
